## Introduction
For our Project we have chosen to implement RL algorithms for the Chop Wood task on MineRL, a challenge where the agent has to enter the sandworld of Minecraft to acheive designated task.

## Algorithms Tested
We are going to be implementing the following techniques to test which algorithm performs the best for the given task.
## Environment Setup
- First we need to install and update Java according to the device you are using. Follow the steps listed in the officiel MineRL [Documentation](!https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html) for the steps.
- Once installed, make sure you have all the requirements installed, which can be done with the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We are going to be using MineRL 0.3.7, for a more stable version and support.
